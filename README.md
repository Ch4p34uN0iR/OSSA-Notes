Notes for ThinkSECURE's Organisational Systems Security Analyst (OSSA) Certification

## Introduction

Information here was sourced from both study guides provided by ThinkSECURE and personal anecdotes from the March 2018 run of the certification examination.

The examination is 4 hours long and includes 45 multiple choice questions with five options. There may be more than one correct answer, no correct answers or all five correct options for each question. For every option that is correctly selected, 1 mark is awarded, and for every incorrect option that is selected, one mark is deducted. To effectively answer a question, you must ensure that the `Answer?` checkbox is checked. If it is not checked, you will be awarded 0 marks for that question since it is considered that you have not chosen to answer that question.

Since this examination involves negative marking, I highly suggest that you do not answer questions that you are completely uncertain of as trying to guess answers to questions brings a higher chance of getting the answers wrong and hence getting more marks deducted.

The bulk of the examination focuses on two topics: analysing network traffic and network scanning. Hence, I would suggest placing more focus on getting comfortable with using wireshark and nmap.
